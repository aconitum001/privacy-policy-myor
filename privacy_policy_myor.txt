Privacy Policy: This Privacy Policy explains how MYOR ("the App") handles your information. MYOR is an offline-first CV-building application with optional AI suggestions. We prioritize your privacy and do not collect, store, or process personal data (e.g., email, IP address, or identifiable information) on our servers. The App operates primarily offline. No personal data is stored in our database. We use Google Analytics to analyze aggregated usage trends (e.g., feature adoption, crashes). This data is anonymized and cannot identify you. Google Analytics adheres to its own Privacy Policy. We do not control or access its data collection methods. Since no personal data is collected, risks associated with storage or transmission are minimized. The App will become open-source after its initial release, allowing transparency into its functionality. Updates to this policy will be posted here with a revised "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of these changes. For questions, email: skandern0000@gmail.com.
